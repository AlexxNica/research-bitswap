  - Bitswap strategy impl testing still underway
- continuing planning/prep for bitswap strategy competition for 2018

- continuing to write bitswap spec
  - currently trying to find time to get up to speed on background
- thinking more about game theory, writing up a .tex summary
  - going ground-up with the theory, rather than top-down like we were starting to do
